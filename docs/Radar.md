WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

Caution is advised.

iNav Radar allows you to see other aircraft in the air if all are equipped with the required components.

iNav Radar requires ESP32 boards.  Check RC Groups for more info.

## DJI Inav Radar

DJI can't use the same analog display of radar as analog system.  However the Craft Name hack allows us to add new items.  

To use build the DJI_Radar branch which will give you iNav 3.0.2 with the required changes.

Follow the iNav setup steps in the rcgroups link.

Set your craft name to :WR

Radar with other items (IE :WSTR) has not been tested.

If more then one aircraft are detected it will cycle through every minute.
